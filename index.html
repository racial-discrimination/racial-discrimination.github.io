                            <p class="triangle-border left">Let’s start by meeting Brisha Borden, an 18 year old girl in Fort Lauderdale. One day Brisha was running late to pick up her god-sister from school when she saw someone’s bike on the road and decided to take it. Someone immediately ran after her to get the bike back and even though Brisha got off the bike, a neighbour called the cops on her and she was charged with burglary and went to jail.</p>

                            <p class="triangle-border left">Right, but what’s strange is that when a white man named Vernon Prater stole tools from a Home Depot and was put in the same jail, a computer told the world that he was less of a criminal than Brisha. This computer used an algorithm that was supposed to give each of them a score that told us how likely they were to commit another crime. Even though both of them stole something, the computer thought Brisha was a high risk and Vernon was low risk.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="container2">
                        <p class="triangle-border2 right">Well was the algorithm right? It seems like it could help if it’s accurate!</p>
                        <div class="image">
                            <img src="img/characters/boykid1/excited.png" width="125" height="125">

                            <p class="triangle-border left">That’s what makes things interesting, the algorithm was wrong. Two years later Brisha never committed any crimes, but Vernon was in jail for stealing again. Imagine a situation where we believed the computer and put Brisha in jail for longer because we thought she would commit a crime again. The scary part is that this actually happens. In states across America, courtrooms use the computer’s evaluation to decide how someone should pay for their crimes, like sending them to jail for a longer time. The scarier part is that when they took a closer look at the algorithm, they found that it often ranked people at a higher risk just because the colour of their skin was black.</p>

                        <p class="triangle-border2 right">That’s weird, how can an algorithm treat people differently because of their skin colour? It can’t technically see people.</p>

                            <p class="triangle-border left">Well let’s talk a little bit about how they work. One example works by asking prisoners questions like When was the first time you were involved with the police? and Have you committed a crime before? These questions might seem like the right ones to ask at first, but let’s look deeper. What if someone lives in an area where there’s a lot of crime? Maybe it’s the only place they can afford to live. Some of these areas have more cops walking around to make sure nothing goes wrong. Just because of this, the person living there might run into cops more often. That doesn’t necessarily mean they’re dangerous or a criminal. What’s worse is that these cops sometimes stop people who look suspicious, and that happens to be African Americans or Hispanics more often than not.</p>

                        <p class="triangle-border2 right">Is the algorithm ever right?</p>

                            <p class="triangle-border left">Sure, the computer’s algorithm might be right sometimes, but by being wrong even one time, we might be keeping someone in jail longer for no reason, or letting someone go free when we shouldn’t.</p>

                            <p class="triangle-border left">You’re right, that’s why this is such a big problem that affects people with coloured skin. If the algorithm took more things into consideration maybe it would work better. For now it’s something that needs to be worked on more by the people who make these algorithms and they need to think about how these algorithms might affect someone’s life.</p>

This kind of technology is used to make things like unlocking phones easier, and it works great in scenarios like this. It is also used by police forces to identify criminals in security footage, and that’s when problems come in. When the technology is used like this, it actually makes mistakes 96% of the time!</p>

                            <p class="triangle-border left">It definitely is a lot! Let’s take a look at a specific case to see what happens. Robert Williams is a black man from Farmington Hills, Michigan. He was arrested because the police thought that he had stolen a watch from a store. The theft was caught on camera, and the police used facial recognition technology to try to find the criminal. The computer said that Robert was the thief. When the police showed him photos from the blurry surveillance footage, he said, “This is not me. I hope y’all don’t think all Black people look alike.” The police realized their mistake, but they still kept him at the station for 30 hours before they let him go. Since that incident, over 11 US cities have banned the use of facial recognition technology by the police. However, many cities still use it.</p>

                            <p class="triangle-border left">Facial recognition by computers is a very complicated process. Let’s say that we give a computer a picture like this:<br>
                                <img src="img/group.png" width="383.333333333" height="247.666666667">

                        <br>First, the algorithm will pick out the faces in the picture. This is pretty easy to do if the image is of a person’s face from a straight-on angle, but is much trickier if their face is turned away, or the lighting is bad. Then, the computer performs calculations such as the distance between the person’s eyes, the size of their nose, or the width of their mouth. The computer will then search through a large database of faces, and try to find one that has the same measurements as the face it’s trying to identify. The computer can also try to guess the person’s age, their gender, and their emotions.</p>

                            <p class="triangle-border left">The main problem with facial recognition technology is that it simply wasn’t built with diverse people in mind. Algorithms like this are very good at identifying white, male faces but very bad at identifying people of color or women and non-binary individuals. That means that the computer will wrongly identify people of colour between 10 and 100 times more often than it will make a mistake on a white man.</p>

                            <p class="triangle-border left">Well, since this technology has so much bias against faces of people of colour, that means that they are much more likely to be wrongfully arrested, like Robert Williams was. Algorithms like this can make discrimination and harmful stereotypes against people of colour even worse. Companies that create this kind of technology say that they are working hard to improve the way their algorithms work, but there is clearly a lot more work that needs to be done to make sure this technology is being used responsibly.</p>

Access to healthcare is something that everyone should have, whether it’s the ability to get a vaccine, or being treated when you’re sick. You would expect people of all races to have equal access to healthcare and that they would be taken care of equally. Sadly this isn’t the case, and once again it’s because of the algorithms involved.</p>

                            <p class="triangle-border left">To better understand what’s going on let's meet Ziad Obermeyer. Ziad studies machine learning and healthcare management at the University of California, Berkeley. During one study he and his team were analyzing data from a hospital when they noticed that an algorithm assigned sick patients who were black with lower risk scores than those who were white.</p>

                            <p class="triangle-border left">It resulted in black people being referred less to personalized care programs. When the researchers looked at the data closer they also saw that the average black person was sicker than the average white person, with diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure. However, these patients received less care, with an average cost of about $1800 USD less than white patients with the same health issues. Out of all the patients that the algorithm assigned to receive extra care, only 17.7% were black, and that number should have been 46.5%.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="container2">
                        <p class="triangle-border2 right">It seems like this is super dangerous, what if someone who is super sick can’t get the care they need?</p>
                        <div class="image">

                            <p class="triangle-border left">That’s why this is such a massive issue. And this is not the only situation where race affects the healthcare that someone receives. In communities with more racial minorities, access to the internet is a major issue. On the surface this might not seem directly related to healthcare but let’s look at one specific case with the COVID-19 vaccine. People were urged to book a vaccine online, since it’s safer and more efficient than other methods, like going in person. The problem is, in areas where there is a lack of internet, people are not able to book a vaccine. Some of these areas are rural parts of the US and developing countries, but some of them are major cities that are under-resourced.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="container2">
                        <p class="triangle-border2 right">That seems unfair, just because you don’t have proper internet access doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be protected from a deadly virus.</p>

                            <p class="triangle-border left">That’s completely true. Whether its direct discrimination from health care providers or systemic racism that shows up in algorithms, receiving equal treatment is extremely important, espcially with people of colour who are not given the same care as others.</p>

                            <p class="triangle-border left">Well the positive side to this whole situation is that people like Ziad are working to find problems and improve algorithms to work better. He actually told the people who developed the algorithm that there it had issues with race and is working with them to improve it. Although this doesn’t solve all the problems where algorithms discriminate based on race, it’s a much needed step in the right direction and hopefully it encourages others to do the same.</p>

Let’s meet Bruce Buffalo, a First Nations man who, after living in the big city for a few years, discovered that his community still had no internet service. He decided to change that by raising money to build a high-speed internet connection himself. He earned the nickname the “Robin Hood of the Internet”, and is now in charge of a company that offers free, public wi-fi access to Samson Cree residents in the Maskwacis townsite and beyond.</p>

                            <p class="triangle-border left">Questions like that and the ones we asked above are problems that many First Nations communities in Canada face every day. According to recent statistics, 96% of Canadians have access to the Internet. However, for Canadians living in the North, where First Nations people make up a majority of the population, the internet access rate is only 79%. And just because the internet is available, it doesn’t mean that it is good enough for regular use. In rural parts of the country, only 40% of users have access to good, fast internet. Many parts of First Nations reserves across the country have no telephone landlines, let alone high-speed internet.</p>

                            <p class="triangle-border left">First Nations communities face some very serious problems, and access to the Internet may not seem like the most important one. However, at a time where the internet is important for both education and work, we can see that if people don’t have equal access, they lose out on many opportunities. In Northern Ontario during the pandemic, while other Canadian students were learning on Zoom, students were forced to talk to their teachers over landlines and get their lessons via fax. Also, the internet has become one of the only ways to find and apply for jobs. This lack of resources is one of the reasons that the number of people without jobs in First Nations communities is very high.</p>

They support a lot of languages, but none of them are African languages. This creates inequalities that exclude some groups of people because if someone speaks a language that is not supported, they can’t use Alexa. In general the experiences of many African citizens are not included when these algorithms are created because their data is not included.</p>

So even if the data represents people of different races, there are differences between people of the same race that need to be incorporated for the algorithm’s data to be inclusive and unbiased.</p>

                            <p class="triangle-border left">That’s very true. And the funny thing is sometimes even if their data is collected, the way it gets processed often leaves them left out. So they provide their data, but don’t get to benefit from it in any way. This idea is something called data colonialism. Companies collect and sell data repeatedly and use it in ways that might not benefit the people who provided the data. It’s been referred to as “digital land grabbing”.</p>

Historically, the tech industry has been made up of mainly men, and more specifically, white men. The percentage of Black employees in high-tech companies is 7.4%, yet about 13% of the US population is Black. Hispanic employees hold about 8% of jobs in high tech, but 18% of the overall population is Hispanic.</p>

                            <p class="triangle-border left">One of the reasons for this is unconscious bias. This is when you form an opinion about someone based solely on first impressions.

                            <p class="triangle-border left">Sure, to illustrate this problem, let’s meet Leslie Miley, who is a former engineering director at Google. Leslie is a Black man who had twice been physically stopped from entering company offices by other coworkers. Google used to have a policy that its workers were allowed to check each other’s ID badges to find unauthorized visitors. They have recently removed this policy because of events like this one: in 2019, Leslie was riding in an elevator in Google’s New York office with a white male co-worker. Leslie’s ID badge was clearly visible on his right hip. The two exited the elevator and were greeted by a security door. Miley allowed his coworker to swipe his badge first, and after he did the other man attempted to push the door shut behind him. <br><br> “I stick my hand out and walk in the door,” Leslie said. “The person’s like, ‘Can I see your badge?’” <br><br>Leslie ignored him and walked away but the man chased him and demanded to see his badge. The man then blocked Leslie’s way and chest bumped him, according to Leslie. Finally, he grabbed Leslie’s badge, which was still hooked up to his hip, and asked why he didn’t just show it to him. <br><br> “I’m looking like, Why did you just initiate physical contact with me?’” Leslie recalled. “He said, ‘We need to make sure that people belong here.’”<br><br></p>

                            <p class="triangle-border left">This happened to Leslie because the other employee thought that Leslie didn’t “look” like a Google employee based on his race. The danger of unconscious bias is that it is unconscious, which means that usually people aren’t aware that they are discriminating against someone based on superficial qualities.</p>

                            <p class="triangle-border left">Even though these aren’t always conscious decisions, they can have a huge impact on important decisions, like who to hire. If someone who is in charge of hiring new employees isn’t aware of their unconscious biases, they will likely hire people who look like them, think like them, and behave like them. This means hiring people of the same race and ethnicity, the same age, and the same educational background, and the same socioeconomic status. Then, these biases spread into the algorithms these people create, and the problems get worse and worse. When [diverse/people of colour] are not included in the creation of these algorithms, then their unique needs are not considered and they end up being discriminated against.</p>

                            <p class="triangle-border left">Companies are increasingly trying to implement diversity and inclusion in their hiring processes, but there is still a long way to go. Cases like Leslie Miley’s show us that we have a long way to go in eliminating unconscious biases in the workplace and beyond.</p>
